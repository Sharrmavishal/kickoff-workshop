## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep peach (#E57341) for a sense of energy and trustworthiness.
- Background color: Very light peach (#F9EBE1) to create a soft, inviting backdrop that complements the primary color without being too visually distracting.
- Accent color: Coral (#E44041), slightly different in hue and saturation than the primary, to make the call to action button more noticeable, indicating this is for Start Solo, but still fitting in well with Start Solo's overall theme.
- Clean and modern fonts to ensure readability and a professional look. The body font is optimized for long-form text, while the headings are slightly bolder to catch the reader's eye.
- Clean and structured layout that is mobile-responsive to guarantee an excellent user experience on all devices. Sections are distinctly divided with enough whitespace and subtle background variations to make it easy to follow and digest.
- Subtle animations, like a fade-in effect when the page loads or a gentle color change on the CTA button hover, to give a sense of polish. Keep it minimal and non-intrusive.
